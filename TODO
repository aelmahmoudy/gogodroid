* Notification v4 compat ?
* background status check after startGogo, user a looper ?
  ** How to specify refreshReceiver only to receive refreshUI broadcast ?
* End after some user-defined timeout if: isAvailable() && !(ifFailover() || (isConnectedOrConnecting() && !isConnected()))
  -> Use CountDownTimer or AlarmManager
* Add config params (server,username,password,...) as settings
  ** Advanced custom settings can be set as in OpenVPN
  ** loadConf can be used to import settings from a file (would require disk access)
* convert Menu -> ActionBar ?
* Display tail -f log in main activity ?
* Check minsdk. Will a compat lib be needed ?
