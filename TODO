* Fix issues with monitorConnection thread:
  ** I suspect that thread might be hogging the CPU sometimes, any help to fix/enhance this thread is apprecitated.
  ** End thread at stopGogoc() ?
* Notification v4 compat ?
* background status check after startGogo, use a looper ?
  ** How to specify refreshReceiver only to receive refreshUI broadcast ?
* End after some user-defined timeout if: isAvailable() && !(ifFailover() || (isConnectedOrConnecting() && !isConnected()))
  -> Use CountDownTimer or AlarmManager
* Add config params as settings:
  ** implement SharedPreferenes.OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener to call saveConf() ?
  ** Select advanced settings to add into shared prefs
  ** loadConf can be used to import settings from a file (would require disk access)
* Display tail -f log in main activity ?
* Check minsdk. Will a compat lib be needed ?
* Use RootCommand library ?
